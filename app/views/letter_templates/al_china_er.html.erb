The grant period is <%= fluxx_request.duration_in_months.to_english if fluxx_request.duration_in_months %> months, from <%=fluxx_request.grant_begins_at.full%> to <%=fluxx_request.grant_ends_at.full%>.</p>

We will forward the second <%= interim_payment_in_currency %> payment upon receipt and approval of an interim narrative and financial report, showing the initial grant payment substantially spent down, according to the schedule on page two of the attached grant agreement.
<% end %>
We will forward the final <%= final_payment_in_currency %> payment upon receipt of your final report that shows <%=fluxx_request.amount_recommended.to_currency_no_cents%> expended for purposes of this project.
